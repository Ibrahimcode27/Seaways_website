# Ibroviza - A Project for the Benefit of the Seafarers ðŸ’™
## description - My 5th Semester mini project. A website which can help connect both seafarers and office holders on land. The main feature of the website is that the officeholders assign duties to seafarers on board. A seafarer can see his/her contract status and also can keep an eye on salary transactions.

### Front-end used: HTML, CSS, JS(negligible) 
### Back-end used: PhpMyAdmin( Majorly ) MySql in Xampp server.

Although this project was a group project major part of coding was done by me. or i can say all of the coding was done by me.
